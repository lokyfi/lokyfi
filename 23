        <h2>Issues Encountered During Playthrough:</h2>
        <p>During my playthrough of the CLI Dungeon Crawl, I had to familiarize myself with basic CLI commands like <span class="highlight">cd</span>, <span class="highlight">dir</span>, <span class="highlight">move</span>, and <span class="highlight">attrib</span>. Understanding their proper usage was essential for progressing through the challenge.</p>

        <h2>Further Research Conducted:</h2>
        <p>The CLI Dungeon Crawl game offered a series of puzzles that required knowledge of basic command-line operations. As I navigated through directories and interacted with various files, I realized the importance of mastering commands like <span class="highlight">move</span> and <span class="highlight">dir /a</span>. These commands were essential for progressing through the game‚Äôs environment, which mirrored a file system exploration. The challenge was not just about performing commands but understanding the consequences of each action, like unlocking doors or revealing hidden chambers. It was a creative blend of problem-solving and learning through trial and error, which made the entire process enjoyable and engaging.</p>

        <h2>Sources of Help:</h2>
        <p>Guidance from AI and Aimana.</p>

        <h2>Overall Experience:</h2>
        <p>I found the CLI Dungeon Crawl to be an engaging and educational experience. It provided a gamified approach to learning fundamental command-line skills, which made the process more enjoyable. The problem-solving aspect, such as unlocking the <span class="highlight">OpenedDoor</span> and eliminating the <span class="highlight">CursedBook.tome</span>, added an element of mystery and discovery.</p>
        <p>Additionally, navigating through directories and using commands effectively reinforced my understanding of file system structures and command-line operations. The final reward, the ASCII Chalice, was a fun conclusion to the adventure.</p>

        <h2>Additional Thoughts:</h2>
