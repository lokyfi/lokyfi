        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Static portfolios often lack interactivity. Visitors may not engage deeply or might miss key parts of the content. A chatbot can guide users and offer tailored answers, improving engagement and accessibility.</p>
        
        <h3>Goals and Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="success">âœ… Integrated Chatbase chatbot into the portfolio site</li>
            <li class="success">âœ… Uploaded curated portfolio content to Chatbase</li>
            <li class="success">âœ… Tested usability and accuracy of responses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Stretch Goals / Extensions</h3>
        <div class="goal">
            <span class="emoji">ðŸŽ¯</span> <strong>Multi-language support:</strong> Added content in a second language (Russian)
        </div>
        <div class="goal">
            <span class="emoji">ðŸŽ¨</span> <strong>Custom welcome message:</strong> Personalized the bot to match the tone of the portfolio
        </div>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Week</th>

            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>

        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>This project enhances a portfolio with an AI chatbot to improve visitor engagement. Chatbase was chosen for its ease of use and ability to train the bot on specific content. The target audience includes potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in the work.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Implementation Process</h3>
        <p><strong>Content Preparation:</strong> Carefully curated portfolio content was organized into logical sections before uploading to Chatbase.</p>
        <p><strong>Integration:</strong> The Chatbase widget was easily embedded into the existing HTML portfolio with just a few lines of JavaScript code.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The free plan has limitations on the number of messages, and initial response accuracy required several iterations of training.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Extensions Implemented</h3>
        <p><strong>Multi-language Support:</strong> Added Russian language responses to make the portfolio accessible to a wider audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Custom Welcome Message:</strong> Created a friendly, personalized greeting that matches the portfolio's tone.</p>
        
        <h3>4. User Testing</h3>
        <p>Tests were conducted with 5 users who asked a variety of questions. Based on their feedback, the bot's responses to common questions were improved and its personality was adjusted to be more professional yet approachable.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This project successfully added an interactive element to the portfolio. Key lessons included the importance of carefully structuring training data and the value of user testing. Future improvements could include adding more specialized knowledge and implementing an analytics dashboard.</p>
